    <p1>
    About me: 
    <br>
    I am a junior computer science major with a minor in statistics and
    geography at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>. I was born in South Plainfield, New Jersey,
    but I currently reside in <a href="https://www.coppelltx.gov/" target="_blank">Coppell</a>, Texas. I would say I am an extrovert who 
    loves connecting with people. Whether that is in a social setting or professional 
    setting, I try to go out and learn new characteris about others. Some interesting 
    facts are that I have visited 49 states in the United States, with the exception 
    being Hawaii. I am left-handed, but as I got older I have learned to use my right 
    hand to challenge myself. Outside of New Jersey and Texas, I have lived in 
    South Dakota, Oklahoma, Connecticut, California, and Georgia. I have one sister 
    and one brother. My sister is currently a sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin, 
    while my brother is in first grade at Mockingbird Elementary School. My father and 
    mother are both software developers, which is where I would say my interest rose to 
    pursue a computer science degree.
    </p1>

    Goals:
    <br>
    Some interests right now I have in computer science is learning and working on different 
    front end designs. Most of my experience comes from back-end languages such as C++ and Java. 
    I have had experience using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank">HTML</a>
    , <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp" target="_blank">CSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, 
    however I think I have to get more experience using the front-end languages. My goal by the end of the year is to hopefully be a 
    full stack developer, where I can transition from the front-end programming to back-end programming with ease.
    <br>
    <br>

    <p3>
    Interests:
    <br>
    In my free time, I love following and playing sports. I love playing chess, basketball, 
    flag football, and tennis. I love watching tennis, basketball, football, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" target="_blank">Formula 1</a>
    . Science Fiction novels and working on personal computer science projects are also some things I like to do in my free time. Traveling 
    would have to be the thing I love to do the most with my free time. My goal is to travel all 195 countries at some point.
